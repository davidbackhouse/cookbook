# People Security

Our team is centric to everything we do, they are important to us. The following
processes help ensure we continue to hire the right people and to keep them
informed and up-to-date with relevant security trends and best practices.

## Screening New Hires

All U.K. candidates must pass a Standard Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS)
check, to cover any criminal records, along with an Electronic Identity check.

For all international hires, the background check must cover, where legal, any
recorded criminal history.

The employment history of all candidates will be verified through references
from at least 2 former employers, where available.

## Training

All new hires will be introduced to our Charter and briefed on the information
security 'fundamentals'. All employees are required to attend a security
refresher session at least once a year, which covers Policy reviews and updates
on best-practices.

## In-Play

Relevant updates, trends and process improvements are shared regularly and
discussed with the team via the #iso27001 Slack channel.
