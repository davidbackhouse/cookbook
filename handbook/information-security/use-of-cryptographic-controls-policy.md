# Use of Cryptographic Controls Policy

This policy contains practical guidelines for the use of cryptographic controls. Data encryption is highly recommended by informations security standards. Introducing a policy and communicating it within the company is one of the best ways to get started for new employees.

## Password generation and storage

Our standards doesn't allow employee to use weak and same passwords for all platforms, that's why is using 1Password is required and included to one of the first steps in onboard programme for new employees.

### 1Password

1Password is a password manager developed by AgileBits Inc. It provides a place for users to store various passwords, software licenses, and other sensitive information in a virtual vault that is locked with a PBKDF2-guarded master password.

1Password integrates with desktop web browsers including Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera. The extension can remember logins for websites, fill in website logins automatically, and generate random passwords for new websites.

On the mobile side, 1Password offers integration with browsers and apps on iOS and Android devices using various methods

## Device encryption and password policies

Just having a strong password is not enough if someone has physically lost a device. Swapping your hard disk into another PC, Mac or linux computer allows for direct data access if the contents are not encrypted. Device encryption is a solution for protecting all of data and information on a device. It converts all of the data stored on your device into a form that can only be read with the correct credentials.

DVELP requires all employees to have encryption enabled on their laptops, PC and mobile devices. There is a [self-declaration sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DV6c4mM0YExWZbqztMBWbKUqNlQjDYSBWLHTuvpn3ls/edit?ts=5c7d50ef#gid=90742438) for devices people are using for work. It includes an information about devices encryption as well.  

## SSH key management

SSH keys pairs provide users ability to connect safely without having to use the password of the remote account. This is very useful tool if you want to connect to remote server or push your code to the remote repository on a regular base. The process of using this technology is the following: create a pair of keys, one private and one public. The private one stays on the machine you will connect from (usually the machine where it is created). The other key, the public key, is put into the remote end by the owner of that account (which may be you) or by the server administrator.

## Encrypting sensitive data in DB's

In Order to protect sensitive data like password or secret tokens we hash or encrypt them before saving to the database.

### Data hashing

DVELP recommends data hashing in a case if we don't need to decrypt value back. For example users' password. Nobody should know that confidential information, that's why we use OpenBSD bcrypt password hashing algorithm, allowing us to easily store a secure hash of your users' passwords. It means we can compare hashes any time when user tries to sign in.

### Data encryption

Data encryption is required if we store some sensitive data in the database and we need to use or pass it through API, e.g. some secret tokens, API keys, keyfiles, etc. We recommend to encrypt these kind of information in the database, in a case if someone try to read confidential information, it will require encryption key to decrypt data. Encryption key shouldn't be stored in same database.

## TLS certificates for web traffic

Protecting any sensitive information is paramount when using the web. Private information like passwords, credit cards credentials, internet bank logins, etc, shouldn't be passed into the wrong hands. That's why internet security measures like encryption are becoming must-haves, not nice-to-haves. DVELP highly recommend to protect all websites with a self-signed TLS/SSL certificates.

TLS (SSL) is a session layer protocol between the Application and Transport layers in an OSI model. SSL (TLS) is a high-level encryption (instead of IPSec), meaning while an outside party may still access your data, it is encrypted and without a key it canâ€™t be decrypted and read.

## Sharing sensitive documentation

Sharing sensitive information or documentation is very common used process in daily routine. To avoid capturing any information by 3rd parties we recommend to send sensitive documentation as password-protected zip file. Password should be send in another channel. For example if zip file was sent through Slack, password should be passed through email. In this case all files will be encrypted and not available for reading by 3rd parties.
